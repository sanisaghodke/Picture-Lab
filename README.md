# Picture-Lab

You will be looking to the PictureTester.java file to see what methods to write.

If you are using Codespaces DO NOT use the Explore method. I've not set up GUI work so this will not currently work on Codespaces. Just use the write method to create new images and you can view those images in the images file. Use the format:

    nameOfImage.write("images/whateverNameYouWant.jpg");

I've listed a few in the main of the PictureTester.java file to try testing and working on. Full list will follow on Monday 2/2
